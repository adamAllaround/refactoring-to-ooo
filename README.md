# Refactoring from anemic to object oriented model
This repository is a basis for exercise. 
It presents a service class - SalaryService which is written in a common anemic model. 
Feel free to use the code of this class to experiment refactoring to object orientation.
You'll find details along with a video in this [allaroundjava blog post.](https://allaroundjava.com/refactoring-anemic-to-object-orientation/)
